# Introduction

Hello and welcome to SG Muslim Book Club! 

This is the official website for this project. 

We plan to make this Club work like an open-library built by the Singapore Muslim Community. We plan to make this platform work like a medium for us to lend out our books as well as borrow books from others. 

With this innitiative, now your books won't collect dust on the shelves anymore, along with that, now you don't have to spend hundreds on books that you are interested in reading. 

Just come over to the [website](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bAxLio17smPqfyaqn39NoETUFPvayQv8n0DblPVflM/edit?usp=sharing) to see what books are available for you to borrow. Inshallah there will be the one you are looking for.

Join this community and help spread islamic knowledge and gain islamic knowledge.
